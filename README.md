This folder contain many algorithms that I wrote for the graduate Machine Learning class at Stony Brook Unvirsity, with Prof. Akoglu:

-Naive Bayes vs. Logistic Regression

-Adaboost

It also contains all my homeworks. For the final project about classifying complex networks, please refer to the specific repository.

Plagiarism is not cool, so please use this work wisely, for your own enlightening. In the end this what really matters.
